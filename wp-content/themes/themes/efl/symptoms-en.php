<h2 class="special-bg"  id="athlete-foot">Athlete’s Foot and Jock Itch</h2>
<h3>What is Athlete’s Foot?</h3>
<p>Do you have itchy, uncomfortable, cracked feet, burning and blisters? You could be suffering from Athlete’s Foot.</p>
<p>Athlete’s Foot, also known as tinea pedis, is a fungal foot infection of the top layer of the skin, which often causes rash, itching, burning and discomfort. It is among the most common fungal infections. There are three clinical forms of Athlete’s Foot, each one affects different parts of the foot and may look different. However, this type of fungus almost always grows in areas that are warm and moist, such as in between the toes. Fungal infection can develop on the feet, as well as in the groin area, better known as jock itch.</p>
<h3>What are the Symptoms of Athlete’s Foot?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Burning feet</li>
<li>Blisters (that do not burst)</li>
<li>Cracks</li>
<li>Flaking</li>
<li>Itching and redness, particularly at night</li>
<li>Peeling</li>
<li>Scaling</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are the causes of Athlete’s Foot?</h3>
<p>Athlete’s Foot is highly contagious and can be transmitted person to person by touching infected areas. Walking barefoot in locker rooms, public pools and other common areas could put you at risk of developing Athlete’s Foot. Certain closed shoes, because of their dark and warm environment, also create an ideal place for fungal growth. Although Athlete’s Foot is contagious, some people are more susceptible than others; for instance, males are more likely to get Athlete’s Foot than women. Other factors that can increase your risk include age (more common in the elderly), and conditions such as diabetes and living in warm and/or damp climates.</p>
<h3>How Do I Treat Athlete’s Foot?</h3>
<p>It is recommended that you treat athlete’s foot at the first sign of symptoms. In most cases, athlete’s foot can be cured with over-the counter antifungal products and good hygiene. The regular use of antifungal powder or cream will, in most cases, eradicate the condition.</p>
<p>Wash and dry your feet, including areas between the toes, twice a day, change socks/stocking daily. Sprinkle antifungal powder, Hongo Killer® Powder or Hongo Killer® Spray Powder on your feet and in your shoes daily to keep your feet dry. Antifungal creams, such as Hongo Killer® cream, as well as liquid such as Hongo Killer® Spray, Hongo Killer® Antifungal Solution or Hongo Killer® Ultra are also effective and should be used at nighttime. Continue treatment for one to two weeks after the infection has cleared to prevent it from recurring.</p>

<h2 class="special-bg" id="stress">Stress</h2>
Do you feel anxious, nervous or worried? Are you having trouble concentrating or sleeping? You could be suffering from stress.
<h3>What is Stress?</h3>
Stress is a typical physical reaction to situations that make you feel threatened, upset or unbalanced. Whenever you sense danger—whether it’s real or imagined—your body’s defense kicks into high gear, also known as the “fight-or-flight” response. This is your body’s way of protecting you. When working properly, stress can actually help you stay vigorous and alert. In fact, in an emergency situation, stress can help save your life by giving you extra strength to defend yourself. Stress can also stop being helpful and start to affect your mood, productivity, health and overall quality of life.

</ul>
<h3>What are the causes of Stress?</h3>
There are many things that cause stress. You may feel stressed before a job interview, a test or an important presentation. These types of short-term stress are very common and typically not a cause for worry. Long-term stress, also known as chronic stress, is caused by different challenging situations in your life such as issues at work or family problems. If left untreated, chronic stress can lead to serious problems.
<h3>Common stress triggers include:</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Your job (being unemployed of unhappy at work)</li>
   <li>Relationship problems</li>
   <li>Financial trouble</li>
   <li>Major life changes (moving, getting married or divorced, loss of a loved one)</li>

</ul>
<h3>How Do I alleviate the symptoms of Stress?</h3>

Our Stress Out® and Serenita® tablets are formulated to provide temporary relief and help promote sleep and relaxation.* Some stress management strategies include physical activity, writing things down or talking to someone about your stress, meditation and breathing exercises.

<h2 class="special-bg" id="memory">Difficulties with Memory</h2>
Are you having trouble remembering things? You could be having memory difficulties.
<h3>What is Memory Loss?</h3>
Memory loss, is unusual forgetfulness that makes it difficult to remember a range of information.

</ul>
<h3>What are the causes of Memory Loss?</h3>
Forgetfulness is a common complaint among older adults. When we grow older, we experience physiological changes that cause weaknesses in brain function, which make us take longer to learn and remember information. While lapses in memory can be frustrating, they typically aren’t a cause for concern.

Fortunately, memory loss in most people is passing, as the brain is capable of producing new brain cells at any age. Your lifestyle, health and day-to-day activities have a significant impact on your brain’s health. That’s why it’s important to exercise your brain, just as you do your muscles.
<h3>How Do I Help My Memory?</h3>
The best way to keep your brain healthy is to keep using it. Remaining socially and intellectually engaged is one of the best things you can do to help improve memory and alertness. Limiting the amount of time you spend multi-tasking, reducing stress, getting more sleep and taking certain supplements can also help you to feel more relaxed and focused. Our Memory Power Plus® tablets offer a formula designed to help alertness and overall mental performance.* Plus, it contains calcium and Ginkgo Biloba for added benefits.

<h2 class="special-bg" id="canker-sore">Canker Sore</h2>
<h3>What are Mouth irritations and Oral Lesions:</h3>
Mouth irritations and oral lesions are swelling, spots or sores on your mouth, lips or tongue. Although there are numerous types of mouth sores and disorders, among the most common are canker sores (Aphthous stomatitis) and cold sores (leukoplakia and candidiasis). If you have a mouth sore, you are not alone, around one third of all people are affected at some point. Nonetheless, mouth sores, irritations and lesions can be painful, unsightly and can interfere with eating and speaking. Any mouth sore that persists for a week or more should be examined by your dentist <span style="font-weight: 400;">or physician</span>.
<h3>How do I know if I have a Mouth Sore or Oral Lesion?</h3>
The following signs may indicate a mouth sore or oral lesion.
<ul>
   <li><b>Canker sores/aphthous stomatitis:</b> Canker sore, also known as an aphthous ulcer, is a single pale or yellow ulcer with red outer ring or a cluster of such ulcers in the mouth, usually on the cheeks, tongue or inside the lips. The cause is not completely understood, but it is thought that the condition represents a T cell mediated immune response which is triggered by a variety of factors. Factors such as stress, trauma, allergies, cigarette smoking, some food and heredity may also make one susceptible. Apthous stomatitis is one of the most common diseases of the oral mucosa and is thought to affect 20% of the general population to some degree. The symptoms range from a minor nuisance, to be disabling in their impact on eating, swallowing and talking.</li>
   <li><b>Cold sores: Also called fever blisters or herpes simplex type 1</b> are a group of painful, fluid-filled blisters that occur on or around the lips and sometimes under the nose or around the chin. Cold sores are usually caused by a type of herpes virus and are contagious. Unlike canker sores, cold sores are contagious from the time the blister ruptures to the time it has completely healed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How are Mouth irritations and Oral Lesions Treated?</h3>
Treatment varies according to the type of condition you have. For the most common types of mouth sores and disorders, described above, treatment is as follow.
<ul>
   <li><b>Canker Sores:</b> Canker sores usually heal after seven to 10 days, although recurrent outbreaks are common. Non-prescription topical ointments and pain relievers can provide temporary relief, alleviating the pain, reducing the inflammation and promoting the healing of the ulcers. Finafta® liquid gives you relief with an antiseptic and anesthetic action, which help to alleviate your canker sore. Rinsing with antimicrobial mouth rinses may help reduce the irritation.</li>
   <li><b>Cold Sores:</b> The blisters usually heal in about a week. Because there is not cure for herpes infections, the blisters may reoccur during times of emotional upset, exposure to sunlight, allergies or fever. Non-prescription topical anesthetics like Finafta® liquid can provide temporary relief. Prescription antiviral drugs may reduce these kinds of viral infections- ask your dentist or physician.</li>
